# Fall-In----AI-Powered-VA-Chatbot

#  This project is a mental health support system designed for veterans, utilizing cutting-edge technologies like React.js and OpenAI's API. The main objective is to detect patterns and indicators of potential suicide rates among veterans, enabling timely intervention and support. To achieve this, the system categorizes veterans' emotional status by analyzing their journal entries, leveraging OpenAI's recommendation capabilities, and utilizing a mood meter as a rating scale.

By incorporating AI-driven analysis, the platform aims to maintain continuity in veterans' engagement in the therapy process. It provides a deeper understanding of veterans' real-time emotional status, enabling VA healthcare teams to access critical information promptly and offer more personalized and effective care. The combination of React.js for the user interface and OpenAI's API for AI-driven insights makes this project a powerful tool in improving mental health support and overall well-being for veterans.
